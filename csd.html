            Data Science is basically a field in which information and knowledge are extracted from the data by using various scientific methods, algorithms, and processes. It can thus be defined as a combination of various mathematical tools, algorithms, statistics, and machine learning techniques which are thus used to find the hidden patterns and insights from the data which helps in the decision making process. Data science deals with both structured as well as unstructured data. It is related to both data mining and big data. Data science involves studying historic trends and thus using its conclusions to redefine present trends and also predict future trends.
